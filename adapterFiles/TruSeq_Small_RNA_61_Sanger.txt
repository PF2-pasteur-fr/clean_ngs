# Please note:
# there are 7 columns:
# 1. name of the sequence
# 2. seqeuence
# 3. fraction of identity between adapter sequence and target sequence (threshold)
# 4. quality threshold
# 5. minimum length of overlap between adapter and target sequence
# 6. if set to 1 perform comparisong with truncated adapter sequences (very time consuming)
# 7. if set to 1 this is a leader sequence (otherwise it is assumed to be an adapter attached to the 3' of the sequence
